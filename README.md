This is a project to explore the history behind the chemical elements. The periodic table is an amazing feat of discovery and organization, but it is more than just protons, neutrons, and numbers. It is a very human story. Learn the story behind the elements of our world.

## Technologies
This web application was built with the following technologies: 
React.js, Webpack, jQuery (npm), Google Maps API (JavaScript Maps/Marker, Geocoder) and Material UI and is hosted on GitHub Pages. 

I created an npm package called ```element-histories``` that serves as a clean API for populating the history information for each element (backstory, image, and country of discovery)! This module was developed from a test-driven approach with both Mocha and the Chai assertion library!

You can check out this npm package out here:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/element-histories

and play around with it here:
https://runkit.com/npm/element-histories 


I hope you enjoy using this application and learning a thing or two about the building blocks of our universe!
